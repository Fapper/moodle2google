moodle2google
=============
This program takes an iCalendar file generated by http://sict.moodle.aau.dk
and returns a better structured iCalendar file. Only really useful for people
studying Computer Science at Aalborg University.

Online version at http://apakoh.dk/projects/moodle2google

Adding ``?debug`` to the above url will set the Content-Type to ``text/plain``
instead of ``text/calendar``.
