Martin's fork of

moodle2google
=============
This program takes an iCalendar file generated by [moodle/moodle](https://github.com/moodle/moodle "moodle github link") and returns a better structured iCalendar file, optionally with undesired courses removed. Note, this is only tested on students attending the School of Information and Communication Technology ([SICT](http://www.sict.aau.dk/)) at Aalborg University, but will most likely work with any installation of moodle.

Online version at http://m2g.martinbmadsen.dk/.

The calendar returned from this parser is valid according to this iCalendar validator:
* http://severinghaus.org/projects/icv/

Usage
-------
Simply follow the two steps below.

* Apply your **user ID**, **moodle token**, and **moodle url** (to get these values, see below) in any order to the location where this program resides, like so (note: these credentials aren't valid):

    * m2g.martinbmadsen.dk  
?u=8399
&token=e87d8abdd212e22cda3e53a687c5a6abdfd83db9  
&moodle=sict.moodle.aau.dk

    This returns an .ics file with your moodle calendar, which Google Calendar, or any other calendar app, can parse. All you have to do is add the above url as one of your calendars, and it will seamlessly update as courses get added, moved, or removed by whoever administrates your moodle.

* If you wish to **remove** a course or multiple courses, you merely supply a comma-separated list of the course names (these will be the titles of the events in Google Calendar) like so:
    * m2g.martinbmadsen.dk  
?u=8399
&token=e87d8abdd212e22cda3e53a687c5a6abdfd83db9  
&moodle=moodle.aau.dk  
&remove=AD2,DEB2

    In this case, two versions of AD and DEB were running at the same time, where I only was attending the first version. Hence I don't want the other scheduled lectures in those courses polluting my calendar and have now removed them from the stream.

And voil√°, you're done!

Getting required parameters
-------
Getting the required parameters for moodle2google is non-trivial. Below is a guide on how to get them:

1. Log in to your insitution's moodle website and visit the calendar. For AAU's moodle, it's [moodle.aau.dk/calendar/view.php](https://www.moodle.aau.dk/calendar/view.php).
2. Scroll to the bottom of the page and right click on the orange __ical__ icon and copy the link address. An example of such a url is: https://www.moodle.aau.dk/calendar/export_execute.php?preset_what=all&preset_time=recentupcoming&userid=8399&authtoken=8c2dd7ca64ac78efc63242c2314e062736c12a0c.
3. The __moodle__ parameter is the root url, so in this case: [moodle.aau.dk](https://www.moodle.aau.dk). Your __userid__ and __authtoken__ are used as __u__ and __authtoken__ in moodle2google, respectively.

Other information
-------
Adding ``?debug=true`` to the above url will set the Content-Type to ``text/plain`` instead of ``text/calendar`` so you can see the generated file before downloading it.

Running
-------
To get this running on your own server, you merely need to be using PHP 5.3+.

TODO
-------
If I ever get time...
- Keep a consistent calendar (moodle only keeps track of the previous and next 240 days)
- Add timezone information to the ics file (VTIMEZONE)
